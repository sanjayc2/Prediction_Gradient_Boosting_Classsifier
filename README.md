# Prediction_Gradient_Boosting_Classsifier
This is a prediction of the likelihood of a ticket being paid, using a real dataset. It was done for an Applied Data Science Coursera project.
The data processing was done using pandas. Two binary classifiers were built - a linear classifier (logistic regresssion w/ L1 regularalizer) and a non-linear classifier (gradient-boosted decision trees). The model building involved feature selection, hyperparameter tuning and training (including validation).
